Open source **automation utility script** for **Prison Lift Clash**.  
This repository is designed to demonstrate structured scripting, interaction automation, and workflow optimization within an interactive game environment.

The project prioritizes **clarity, transparency, and educational value**, focusing on reducing repetitive actions while maintaining a clean and readable codebase.

---

## ✨ Overview

**Prison Lift Clash — Utility Script** provides a controlled automation system that simulates routine gameplay interactions in a minimal and observable way.

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Demonstrate automation behavior during gameplay testing  
- Showcase simple scripting logic and control flow  
- Reduce repetitive manual input in progression-based mechanics  
- Serve as a reference for automation structure and design  

This project is intended **strictly for educational and experimental purposes**, helping users understand how automation logic can be organized and maintained in interactive environments.

---

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

This repository follows several key principles:

- **Transparency** — no hidden logic or concealed behavior  
- **Simplicity** — minimal setup and easy-to-follow structure  
- **Modularity** — components can be extended or modified  
- **Educational focus** — designed for learning, not exploitation  

The script does not attempt to interfere with protected systems or alter core game mechanics.
